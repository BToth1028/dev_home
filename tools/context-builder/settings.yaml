# Chunking parameters (research-based)
chunk_size: 1000          # Target size (800-1200 range optimal)
chunk_overlap: 120        # ~12% overlap maintains context
min_chunk_size: 200       # Discard fragments

# Retrieval parameters (research-validated)
top_k: 12                 # Top chunks to include (8-12 optimal)
relevance_threshold: 0.7  # Filter low-quality results

# Output constraints (Cursor best practices)

# Queries for context generation (customize for your needs)
queries:
  - project standards and coding conventions
  - recent architecture decisions
  - directory structure and file organization
  - testing patterns and requirements
