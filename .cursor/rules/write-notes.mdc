# Documentation & Decision Recording Rules

## File Naming Convention

All documentation files MUST follow this pattern:
```
YYYY-MM-DD_descriptive-title.md
```

**Examples:**
- ✅ `2025-10-26_setup-engineering-home.md`
- ✅ `2025-11-03_postgres-connection-pooling.md`
- ❌ `notes.md`
- ❌ `doc1.txt`
- ❌ `Untitled.md`

## Decision Document Template

Every significant decision or AI conversation summary MUST use this structure:

```markdown
# <Short Title>

**Date:** <YYYY-MM-DD>
**Source:** <ChatGPT | Claude | Cursor | Manual>
**Context:** <1–2 lines explaining why this decision was made>

---

## Original Prompt
> "<paste the original question or request>"

---

## Key Takeaways
- <3–7 bullet points summarizing the main insights>

---

## Implementation Guide
<step-by-step instructions, code snippets, commands, guardrails>

---

## Related
- See also: ../<area>/<date>_<topic>.md
- Related issue: #123
- Related PR: #456
```

## Documentation Categories

**Project-specific docs:** Go in the project repo under `docs/`
- ADRs specific to one project
- API documentation for one service
- Setup guides for one app

**Org-wide docs:** Go in engineering-home under `docs/`
- Cross-project standards
- Architecture decisions affecting multiple services
- Shared infrastructure documentation
- Team processes and workflows

## When to Create a Decision Document

Create a decision doc when:
- Making architecture or technology choices
- Establishing team standards or conventions
- Receiving valuable AI-generated guidance worth preserving
- Making reversible but significant decisions (document the rationale)
- Onboarding needs historical context

Skip decision docs for:
- Trivial bug fixes
- Routine maintenance
- Self-evident changes
- Temporary experiments

## Best Practices

1. **Update, don't duplicate:** If updating an old decision, append a "## Updates" section with date
2. **Link related docs:** Always add "Related" section with cross-references
3. **Be concise:** Aim for scannable bullet points over long paragraphs
4. **Include examples:** Show concrete code/commands, not just abstract concepts
5. **Date everything:** Every doc should have creation date and last-updated date

## Organizing GPT Summaries

1. Save to `docs/gpt-summaries/_inbox/` first
2. Within 1 week, move to proper category:
   - `architecture/` – System design, patterns
   - `coding-patterns/` – Code organization, best practices
   - `devops/` – Deployment, CI/CD, infrastructure

## Cursor Integration

When Cursor creates documentation:
- Auto-apply the YYYY-MM-DD naming pattern
- Use the decision template for AI conversations
- Place in `_inbox/` if category is unclear
- Add context headers (Date, Source, Context)
