# GPT Summaries - Inbox

**Purpose:** Temporary holding area for AI-generated summaries.

## Workflow

1. **Save immediately** when you get something useful from AI
2. **Add basic metadata** (date, source)
3. **Review weekly** and move to proper category:
   - `../architecture/`
   - `../coding-patterns/`
   - `../devops/`

## Keep This Clean

This folder should be empty or near-empty. It's a staging area, not permanent storage.

**Review frequency:** At least weekly
