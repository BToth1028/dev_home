# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document significant decisions affecting the engineering workspace.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures:
- **Context** - What problem are we solving?
- **Decision** - What did we decide?
- **Consequences** - What are the impacts?
- **Alternatives** - What else did we consider?

## Creating a New ADR

Use the automation script:

```powershell
.\scripts\new-adr.ps1 "Decision title"
```

This creates a new file from the template with today's date.
